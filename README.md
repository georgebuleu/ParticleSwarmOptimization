# ParticleSwarmOptimization
This repository contains the implementation of a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm for the optimization of communication network routing. The algorithm is implemented in C# using the WinForms framework. It is designed to solve optimization problems in which the objective function is not necessarily convex.
